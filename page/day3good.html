				<div id="title">Day 3:</div>
				<div id="description"> <p>"That is correct" the voice says, as the ball of light expands and the darkness quickly recedes.  The light is so bright and blinding that you're forced to close your eyes. </p>  
				<p>YWhen you open your eyes again, you find yourself in your cozy bed with a few minutes to go before your alarm rings and a hazy memory of what you had dreamed about.</p>
				<p>That day at work is mostly spent making minor tweaks and revisions as suggested by your boss. You still have a backlog of your regular work, but your boss tells you that it's okay to just focus on the department meeting for now and get back to it after. You have your annual health check-up scheduled for today, so you just finish the revisions and leave work early.</p></div>
